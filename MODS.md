# Local modifications

The `import-2014` commit is **not** stock 2014 code. It is stock code plus four
changes that were already applied to the working copy before git existed here,
plus mods added afterward -- see the *Since* column below. No pristine copy
exists on disk, so the import could not be split into a vanilla baseline plus
mods.

This file is the substitute for that baseline. Keep it current.

## Applied mods

The first four rows were already applied to the working copy before git existed
here; later rows are marked with the date they were added, in the *Since*
column.

What each one does:

- **`SERV_IRUHADEV_SKILLTREE_NO_LOCK`** -- both skills in a 2-choice skill tree
  row can be learned; the unchosen one is no longer locked out. Also hides the
  "AbleChoice" select-indicator picture on the left-hand skill slot, since
  that overlay implied an either/or choice that no longer exists.
- **`SERV_IRUHADEV_SKILL_SLOT_B_FREE`** -- Skill Slot B is open by default and
  permanent. No medal purchase, and the server keeps the permanent-sentinel end
  date rather than expiring it.
- **`SERV_IRUHADEV_BUFF_DURATION_TEXT`** -- draws a remaining-seconds countdown
  over each buff/debuff icon on the status HUD.
- **`STATIC_AUTO_LOGIN`** -- skips the login screen and signs in with a fixed
  account, overriding whatever the publisher switch decided.
- **`SERV_IRUHADEV_QUICK_SLOT_FULL_FREE`** -- all 6 equipped consumable quick
  slots are open from character creation. No cash ticket, no `LOCK` overlay,
  and the Quick Slot Expansion ticket (item 244560, plus the Ara/Elesis
  variants) is hidden from the cash shop. The server pins inventory category
  11 (`ST_E_QUICK_SLOT`) to exactly 6 slots on load, so a legacy `+3` purchase
  row already sitting in `dbo.GItemInventorySize` no longer stacks on top of
  the new base.
- **`SERV_IRUHADEV_OFFLINE`** -- makes the client playable with no servers
  running. `KSession` hands every outbound packet to an in-process emulator
  (`CX2OfflineServer`) instead of a socket, and the emulator answers on the
  same session at the point the real receive path queues into, so everything
  above the socket layer runs unmodified. All player state persists to a local
  SQLite file, `els_db.sql`, in the game directory. Client-only: no packet
  struct, event ID or shared enum is touched, so the servers do not need
  rebuilding. See `OFFLINE_MODE_PLAN.md` for the design and the phase history,
  and the *Offline mode* section of `CLAUDE.md` for the three seams.

  **It also fills a dungeon party with AI characters, and only through the
  auto-party button.** Pressing auto-party queues, matches and opens the
  dungeon with three of the game's named hero NPCs on the player's team -
  drawn at random, placed on the line map's own party start slots, fighting
  with ally AI, revived when they go down, kept across a stage change, and
  given HP/MP bars, portraits, names and levels in the real party HUD. The
  ordinary start button is untouched and still goes in alone: the entire
  scope guard is that a solo room sends no bot slots, so every client-side
  branch is a no-op on that path. An auto-party run pays exactly the same EXP
  as a solo one. The party members are `CX2GUNPC`s using the PvP-bot slot
  mechanism the studio already shipped, so a bot's moveset is its own scripted
  one rather than a player's skill tree, and no P2P peer is added for it.
  Their difficulty is three named constants in `X2Lib/X2Define.h`, applied in
  `CX2Game::SetUserSummonedNPCInfo`. See `AI_PARTY_PLAN.md` for the design and
  the six phases.

  **This flag has to be defined in two places.** `X2ServerProtocol` does not
  include `KTDX.h`, so `KTDXLIB/Always.h` alone does not reach the socket seam:
  it must *also* be in `X2ServerProtocol_2010.vcxproj`'s `US_SERVICE`
  `PreprocessorDefinitions`. Set only one and nothing fails to compile --
  `g_pX2OfflineHook` is declared in a header whose flag-conditional body the
  two projects then disagree about, and the client goes back to trying to
  reach a real server. Toggle both together, always.
- **`SERV_IRUHADEV_NO_PATCHER_TOKEN`** -- lets `x2.exe` be started directly
  instead of only through a launcher that passes the patcher token. A
  `_SERVICE_` build compares `argv[1]` against `PATCHER_RUN_ONLY` and returns
  0 out of `WinMain` if it does not match, so a bare launch (double-click, a
  debugger, a shortcut) exited instantly with no window, no message box and no
  log line. The flag supplies that same constant at the call site rather than
  reading it out of `argv`; the two tests are left standing and the token is
  still accepted when passed, so a launcher or `start_offline.bat` keeps
  working unchanged. Independent of offline mode, and useful without it.

  Verified by probe, not by reading `#ifdef`s: in `US_SERVICE` this is the
  **only** live `argv` read in the client. The other nine
  (`X2.cpp:756-778`, `X2Main.cpp:1083`, `1292-1301`, `1438-1460`, `1478`) are
  all behind flags that are off -- `LAUNCHER_COMMAND_ARGUMENT`,
  `CLOSE_ON_START_FOR_GAMEGUARD`, `CLIENT_PURPLE_MODULE*`,
  `SERV_CHANNELING_AERIA`, `SERV_COUNTRY_PH`, `_NEXON_KR_`, `ARGUMENT_LOGIN`,
  `SERV_STEAM`. Several of them read `__argv[1]`/`[2]` with no NULL guard, so
  that mattered.
- **`SERV_IRUHADEV_JOBCHANGE_PORTRAIT`** -- refreshes the top-left gage
  portrait when a quest changes the character's class. The quest path resets
  the 3D square unit but never the gage, so the HUD kept drawing the old class
  until the gage was rebuilt on a state change; every other class-change path
  in the client already refreshes it.
- **`SERV_IRUHADEV_AIPARTY_PERSIST`** -- the offline AI party survives a stage
  change instead of being rebuilt at every one of them. Requires
  `SERV_IRUHADEV_OFFLINE` and is defined under it.

  `CX2DungeonGame::StageLoading` calls `DeleteAllNPCUnit()`, which used to
  sweep the three bots away with the stage's monsters; `CreateOfflinePartyBots`
  then had to spawn all three again at `SubStageStart`, which costs a packet
  round trip plus three `CX2GUNPC` constructions and lands after the loading
  curtain has already lifted -- so the player fought alone for a moment at
  every stage and then watched three heroes pop in.

  A real multiplayer party never pays that: `CX2GUUser` units are built once in
  `CX2Game::UnitLoading` and `StageLoading` merely repositions them. This flag
  gives a bot the same lifetime. `DeleteAllNPCUnit` spares a *living* party bot
  while `m_bOfflineKeepPartyBots` is set (only around that one call), the way it
  already spares monster-card summons, and `RepositionOfflinePartyBots` places
  the survivors on the new stage's line map beside the user-unit loop. A dead
  bot is deliberately not spared -- letting it go means the ordinary spawn path
  rebuilds it whole on the new stage, which is a free revive while the stage is
  loading anyway.

  Reverting it restores per-stage respawning, which still works; the placement
  helper `GetOfflinePartyBotPos` is shared by both paths and is not gated.

- **`SERV_IRUHADEV_MP_REGEN_BOOST`** -- quality of life: raises the base MP
  regeneration rate for player units from 1 MP/s to
  `SERV_IRUHADEV_BASE_MP_REGEN_PER_SEC` (50 MP/s), the single tuning knob, in
  `X2Lib/X2Define.h`.

  The base rate is not a constant in the shipped client -- it is
  `MP_CHANGE_RATE` out of each class's Lua, read into
  `CX2GUUser::m_fOriginalMPChangeRate` at both of the two places that load it
  (`InitAndInsertToGame` and `InitComponent`) and then pushed into the gage by
  `ResetMPChangeRate()`. The flag raises the value at those two load points
  only, as a **floor** rather than an assignment, which is what keeps it from
  breaking anything downstream:

  - everything that composes on top of the base still composes -- Aisha's
    Meditation, Rena's charge states, Eve's passives, socket
    `m_fSpeedUpManaGather`, title and drag-and-set mana-recovery options all
    read `GetOriginalMPChangeRate()` and add to or scale it;
  - the PvP play-channel scale (x7 in `ResetMPChangeRate`, /7 in
    `GetNowMPChange`) is unaffected, since it wraps the base either way;
  - a class whose Lua already asks for more than the floor keeps its own
    higher value.

  Two things it deliberately does **not** touch. The socket-item MP option
  (`SetMPChangeRateValue`, `KSocketData::m_iMPChangeValue`) is a separate
  additive path and is left at its item-driven value. And the two absolute
  `ResetMPChangeRate( 3.f )` / `( 10.f )` calls behind Eve's `SMI_EVE_MEMO5`
  skill note (`X2Lib/X2GuEve.cpp:8665`) overwrite the base outright while that
  memo is equipped, so Eve regenerates *slower* than the floor in that one
  state. Both are class/item behaviour rather than the general base rate, which
  is what this flag is scoped to.

  NPC and monster MP is untouched -- `CX2GUUser` is the player-unit class. In
  online play MP is client-simulated per unit and P2P-synced, so a remote
  player running an unmodded client will regenerate at their own rate.

  **The village map needed a second site.** `XS_VILLAGE_MAP` does not regen MP
  through the unit's change rate at all. `CX2GageManager::OnFrameMove` runs a
  fixed 1.0 s timer (`m_ElapsedTimeCheckVillageBuff`) that calls
  `CX2GageSet::UpNowHpAndMpInVillage()`, which does a hardcoded
  `UpNowMp( 1.f )` straight onto the HUD's own `CX2GageData` -- the my-gage-set
  has no game unit attached in town, so `UpdateGageDataFromGameUnit()` degrades
  to a self-copy and the unit's rate never reaches the bar. That is the only
  hardcoded periodic MP tick in the client (every other literal `UpNowMp` is
  hit- or skill-driven), and it is why the first cut of this flag looked like
  it had done nothing while idle in a village but clearly worked in a dungeon.
  The tick is now worth one second of the base rate; since the period is
  exactly 1.0 s the constant goes in unscaled.

  **And dungeons and fields needed a third site, which is the one that
  mattered.** Raising the base rate had no effect there at all, and the reason
  is a stock bug: `CX2GUUser::InitComponent` sets the rate from the class Lua
  near the top, then further down -- in the `default` branch of the game-type
  switch, i.e. everything that is not PvP and not the training room -- does

  ```cpp
  CX2GageManager::GetInstance()->RestoreGageData();
  m_pGageData = CX2GageManager::GetInstance()->GetMyGageData()->GetCloneGageData();
  ResetMaxHP();
  ResetMaxMP();
  SetNowHp( ... ); SetNowMp( ... );
  ```

  The clone replaces the **whole** `CX2GageData`, so the MP change rate set
  minutes earlier in the same function is thrown away. The four calls after it
  restore the maxima and the current values; nothing restores the rate, and the
  clone carries the gage manager's, which no code ever sets -- it is the `1.0f`
  default out of `CX2GageData::Gage::Init()`. So in stock code a class's
  `MP_CHANGE_RATE` is dead in dungeons and fields, and every character
  regenerates at exactly 1 MP/s there regardless of what its Lua asks for. It
  survives only in the PvP and training branches, which do not re-clone.

  The flag re-applies `ResetMPChangeRate( GetOriginalMPChangeRate() )`
  immediately after that `ResetMaxMP()`. With the flag off the line is gone and
  stock behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged, bug included.

  **This was found by measuring, not by reading.** Three rounds of static
  analysis got it wrong, because every writer of the rate looked correct in
  isolation -- the value was right when set and the thing that destroyed it
  does not mention MP at all. A temporary `SERV_IRUHADEV_MP_REGEN_DEBUG` flag
  logging one `[MPDBG]` line per second into `offline_server.log` settled it in
  one play-test: `InitComponent` logged `rateMp=20.000`, every per-frame sample
  a second later logged `rateMp=1.000` with `orig=20.000` still intact, which
  localises the loss to the gage object rather than the value. That asymmetry
  -- member right, gage wrong -- is also what made the class states look like
  they were working while idle regen was not: Aisha and Rena recompute from
  `GetOriginalMPChangeRate()`, which reads the member the clone never touched.
  See the *Deploying the offline client* section of `CLAUDE.md` for the
  diagnostic pattern.

### Offline 3x EXP and 3x drop rate

**Defined in** `KTDXLIB/Always.h` -- `SERV_IRUHADEV_OFFLINE_EXP_BOOST` and
`SERV_IRUHADEV_OFFLINE_DROP_BOOST`, both nested under `SERV_IRUHADEV_OFFLINE`.
**Rates** live together at the tail of `X2Lib/X2Define.h`: `_EXP_RATE`,
`_ED_RATE`, `_QUEST_ITEM_RATE` (all `3.0f`) and `_DROP_DRAWS` /
`_STATIC_DROP_DRAWS` (both `3`). That is the one place to retune -- set a rate
to `1.0f` or a draw count to `1` to switch that half off without touching the
flags.

Quality of life for solo play. Offline has none of the live server's rate
bonuses: party, PC bang, premium, event and channel EXP are all either
display-only or not compiled in offline, and `X2OfflineDropTable.h:99` records
that the four multipliers the real server folds into a drop are hard-coded to
1.0 here. So the curve is the full retail one with nothing on top of it.

Covered: monster EXP and ED, dungeon-clear bonus EXP (for free -- it is 30% of
the run total), quest reward EXP and ED, monster and static/place item drops,
and quest collection items. Not covered, deliberately: cube/box contents
(`X2OfflineRandomItem`), and the display-only bonus fields (`m_iPartyEXP`,
`m_iSocketOptEXP`, `m_nPremiumBonusEXP`, ...) -- filling those would make the
EXP bar disagree with the database.

Two things here are not the obvious implementation, and both matter:

- **EXP is multiplied where the reward is *minted*, not where it is stored.**
  `Handlers_Room.cpp` scales `iEXP` immediately after the battlefield factor
  and before `m_kRoom.m_iRewardEXP` accumulates, because every figure the
  player sees and every figure that is stored derives from that one local: the
  `ApplyDungeonReward` write, the `m_EXPList` number the client adds to its own
  bar as `EGS_NPC_UNIT_DIE_NOT` arrives, the clear bonus, and the result
  screen's `m_nOldEXP` / `m_nEXP`. Multiplying inside `ApplyDungeonReward`
  instead -- the one-line change, and the tempting one -- would triple the
  stored total while still telling the client the unboosted number, and the
  result screen's bar can then animate **backwards**.

- **Drops repeat the draw; they do not scale the probability.**
  `CX2OfflineDropTable::Decide` is a weighted *single pick* over one
  accumulated list, not a per-item coin flip. Tripling `m_fProb` would not give
  3x: real rows already sum to ~82% (`DropTable.lua:1686`), so tripling pins
  the total at 100% -- about 1.2x actual -- and silently makes every case
  listed after the accumulator passes 100 unreachable. Repeating the draw is
  what the studio's own drop-rate event does
  (`KncWX2Server/CenterServer/KDropTable.cpp:1284`, under
  `SERV_ITEM_DROP_EVENT`), and it multiplies the expected item count exactly
  while leaving every rarity ratio alone. The **inner group draw stays at one**
  -- a group is a near-uniform selector (group 1 is eight rows of 12.5), not a
  rarity gate, so repeating it would saturate the group and pin every group win
  to its first item.

  The quest collection-item roll is the exception: that one *is* a true
  per-item roll, so it is scaled directly and clamped to 100.

The monster row and the static (place) row have separate draw counts because
they are different kinds of loot -- the monster row is where gear comes from,
the static row is where the ordinary consumables come from (Aqua has a static
row in nearly every dungeon at 5-10%). Drop `_STATIC_DROP_DRAWS` back to `1`
on its own if the potion clutter gets tiresome.

`offline_server.log` gets a `BOOST` line at startup naming all five values. It
is printed unconditionally -- with the vanilla numbers when the flags are off
-- because the question it answers is "did my rebuild actually take", and a
line that only appears when the boost is compiled in cannot tell a disabled
boost apart from a stale PCH.

Client-only; no server rebuild. Nothing under `KncWX2Server/Common/` is
touched, so the wire format is unchanged. Reverting is safe at any time: only
future gains are scaled, nothing migrates, and the character is untouched.


## Reverting to stock

Comment out every `#define` listed in the *Defined in* column and rebuild.
No git operation is needed -- the flag system is the revert switch. That is the
main reason a reconstructed vanilla baseline was not worth building.

Reverting `SERV_IRUHADEV_QUICK_SLOT_FULL_FREE` specifically can move player
data: any item sitting in quick slot 4, 5, or 6 falls outside the stock 3-slot
category size, so on next login `KInventory::Init()` routes it through the
same `mapWrongPosItem` path stock code already uses for any item found outside
its category's current bounds -- it is not deleted, just relocated out of the
quick-slot bar.

## Rebuild requirements

`SERV_IRUHADEV_SKILLTREE_NO_LOCK`, `SERV_IRUHADEV_SKILL_SLOT_B_FREE`, and
`SERV_IRUHADEV_QUICK_SLOT_FULL_FREE` all touch
`KncWX2Server/Common/ServerDefine.h`, which compiles into **both** sides.
Toggling any of them requires rebuilding the VS2010 client *and* the five
servers, with the flag set consistently in both. Rebuild only one side and the
wire format desynchronizes silently at runtime instead of failing to compile.

The remaining six -- `SERV_IRUHADEV_BUFF_DURATION_TEXT`,
`STATIC_AUTO_LOGIN`, `SERV_IRUHADEV_OFFLINE`,
`SERV_IRUHADEV_NO_PATCHER_TOKEN`, `SERV_IRUHADEV_JOBCHANGE_PORTRAIT` and
`SERV_IRUHADEV_MP_REGEN_BOOST` -- are client-only. None of them touches
anything under `KncWX2Server/Common/`, so the servers never need rebuilding
for any of them. Two caveats:

- `SERV_IRUHADEV_OFFLINE` needs **both** of its definition sites toggled
  together, and all three client libs plus the exe rebuilt (`KTDXLIB`,
  `X2ServerProtocol`, `X2Lib`, then `X2`).
- Toggling anything in `KTDXLIB/Always.h` -- which is every
  `SERV_IRUHADEV_*` flag -- means rebuilding **all four** projects, because
  `Always.h` sits inside each one's precompiled header. msbuild does not
  always notice, and a stale PCH makes the flag simply absent at the call
  site with no error: the `#else` branch compiles and the change appears to
  have done nothing. If in doubt, prove it rather than assume it -- put a
  `#pragma message` inside the `#ifdef` at the call site, rebuild that one
  project, and read the compiler output.

## Known deviations to clean up

`STATIC_AUTO_LOGIN` breaks the project rule in CLAUDE.md two ways:

1. It is not `SERV_IRUHADEV_`-prefixed.
2. It lives in `KTDXLIB/OnlyGlobal/Always_US.h` instead of `KTDXLIB/Always.h`.
   That file is only pulled in for `CLIENT_COUNTRY_US`, so the change is
   silently US-only and will not survive a look at any other region config.

It also stores a plaintext account password in a header that compiles into the
shipped executable. Acceptable for a local-only repo; worth moving to an
untracked local header if this ever gets pushed anywhere.
